- 👋 Hi, I’m James Michael Patrick Brady / @RelativisticCanoe
- 🎓 Graduated with a 2:1 MPhys Physics with Astrophysics (Hons) from the University of Manchester
- 👀 I’m interested in solving physical problems through the use of programming languages and simulations, alongside applying analytical techniques to find patterns in data
- 🌱 I’m currently seeking my first career job, in the meantime I'm volunteering for a local art gallery and engaging 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that makes use of my background in physics/data analysis that doesn't involve defense contracts or financial tech
- 📫 How to reach me: contact me via my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-m-p-brady/) as listed on my profile
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: In my spare time, I enjoy creating 3D objects and procedural material art in Blender

You can find a small portfolio of work that I completed over the course of MPhys degree with the University of Manchester here:
- [Numerical Simulations of Spring Systems using Python](https://github.com/RelativisticCanoe/University-Projects/blob/main/Spring%20Simulation%20-%20Mar.%20'22.ipynb) (2nd Year Assignment)
- [Monte Carlo Simulations of Neutron Scattering and Absorbtion in Materials](https://github.com/RelativisticCanoe/University-Projects/blob/main/Neutron%20and%20Material%20Simulation%20-%20May%20'22.ipynb) (2nd Year Assignment)
- [Optical Trapping using Laser Tweezers](https://github.com/RelativisticCanoe/portfolio_documents/blob/main/Optical%20Trapping%20using%20Laser%20Tweezers%20Lab%20Report%20-%20Mar%20'23.pdf) (3rd Year Lab)
- [Matrix Class and Operations in C++](https://github.com/RelativisticCanoe/University-Projects/blob/main/OOP%20in%20C%2B%2B%20Assignments%20-%20Feb%20-%20May%20'23/Assignment%205%20-%20Matrix%20Maths/matrix_class.cpp) (3rd Year Assignment)
- [Astrophysical Object Catalogue in C++](https://github.com/RelativisticCanoe/University-Projects/tree/main/OOP%20in%20C%2B%2B%20Assignments%20-%20Feb%20-%20May%20'23/Project%20-%20Celestial%20Object%20Catalogue) (3rd Year Assignment)
- [Optical Simulations of Cherenkov Radiation in Geant4 and Mitsuba 3](https://github.com/RelativisticCanoe/portfolio_documents/blob/main/Optical%20Simulations%20of%20Cherenkov%20Radiation%20Project%20Report%20-%20Jan%20'24.pdf) (MPhys Project)

Currently, I am working on a [V2 of my Astrophysical Object Catalogue](https://github.com/RelativisticCanoe/Astronomical-Catalogue-V2) in my free time, which encompasses a complete rewrite/refactor of the previous codebase
into multiple headers and source files and possible extensions and enhancements (i.e. a GUI, graphs etc.) to the original design. This personal project is
a chance to demonstrate my familiarity with C++ as a language, my ongoing commitment to learning best practises/impoving my abilities and to demonstrate that
I can write simple but competent software.

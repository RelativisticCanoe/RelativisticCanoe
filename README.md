- 👋 Hi, I’m James Michael Patrick Brady / @RelativisticCanoe
- 👀 I’m interested in solving physical problems through the use of programming languages and simulations
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to enter an industry job for the first time
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that makes use of my background in physics/data analysis that doesn't involve defense contracts or financial tech
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at james.m.p.brady@gmail.com (preferred) or call my personal phone number: +44 07842 088065.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I really enjoy making 3D objects and procedural material art in Blender


You can find a small portfolio of work that I completed over the course of MPhys degree with the University of Manchester here:
- Numerical Simulations of Spring Systems using Python (2nd Year Assignment)
- Optical Trapping using Laser Tweezer (3rd Year Lab)
- Matrix Class and Operations in C++ (3rd Year Assignment)
- Astrophysical Object Catalogue in C++ (3rd Year Assignment)
- Optical Simulations of Cherenkov Radiation in Geant4 and Mitsuba 3 (MPhys Project)

Currently, I am working on a V2 of my Astrophysical Object Catalogue in my free time, which encompasses a complete rewrite/refactor of the previous codebase
into multiple headers and source files and possible extensions and enhancements (i.e. a GUI, graphs etc.) to the original design. This personal project is
a chance to demonstrate my familiarity with C++ as a language, my ongoing commitment to learning best practises/impoving my abilities and to demonstrate that
I can write simple but competent software.

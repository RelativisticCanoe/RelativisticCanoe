- 👋 Hi, I’m James Michael Patrick Brady / @RelativisticCanoe
- 🎓 Graduated with a 2:1 MPhys Physics with Astrophysics (Hons) from the University of Manchester
- 👀 I’m interested in solving physical problems through the use of programming languages and simulations, alongside applying analytical techniques to find patterns in data
- 🌱 I’m currently seeking my first career job, in the meantime I'm volunteering for a local art gallery and engaging 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that makes use of my background in physics/data analysis that doesn't involve defense contracts or financial tech
- 📫 How to reach me: contact me via my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-m-p-brady/) as listed on my profile
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: In my spare time, I enjoy creating 3D objects and procedural material art in Blender

## Skills:

You can find a small portfolio of work that I completed over the course of MPhys degree with the University of Manchester here:
- Numerical Simulations of Spring Systems using Python (2nd Year Assignment)
- Optical Trapping using Laser Tweezer (3rd Year Lab)
- Matrix Class and Operations in C++ (3rd Year Assignment)
- Astrophysical Object Catalogue in C++ (3rd Year Assignment)
- Optical Simulations of Cherenkov Radiation in Geant4 and Mitsuba 3 (MPhys Project)

Currently, I am working on a V2 of my Astrophysical Object Catalogue in my free time, which encompasses a complete rewrite/refactor of the previous codebase
into multiple headers and source files and possible extensions and enhancements (i.e. a GUI, graphs etc.) to the original design. This personal project is
a chance to demonstrate my familiarity with C++ as a language, my ongoing commitment to learning best practises/impoving my abilities and to demonstrate that
I can write simple but competent software.
